# Phase 1 Project: EZ Recipes
The purpose of this project is to provide end users with a no fuss application to submit and preview cooking recipes. In order to submit new recipes to the application, a user must first fill out the following:

* Recipe name
* Recipe image URL
* Recipe ingredients
* Recipe steps

Once all of these fields are completed, the user can press the submit button to add their recipe to the existing list of recipes saved on the db.json. All recipes are automatically loaded and previewed below the input form. Users also have the ability to delete any recipe using the "delete button"

### Requirements
* Have json-server installed

### Installation Instructions
* Fork and clone from following gitHub
* Run json-server for db.json
* Open index.html in browser

### Future Enahncements
* Give users the ability to add recipe tags that can be used to search or filter (i.e. (vegetarian, meat, vegan) or (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack))
* Create a filter or search bar to allow users to narrow their recipe list
* Add a rating system for users to provide input
* Standarize the container size for each recipe and allow for expansion of recipe container if more detail is provided
